# DevOps Pipeline Design
## Understanding DevOps in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## 1. Need/Background of DevOps and Its Requirement in SDLC

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** encompasses all stages of software creation, from initial planning and requirements gathering to development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Traditionally, the SDLC has been segmented into distinct phases, often managed by separate teams such as Development and Operations. This separation has historically led to several challenges:

- **Siloed Teams**: Development and Operations teams often operate independently, leading to miscommunication and misaligned objectives.
- **Delayed Deployments**: The handoff between development and operations can introduce delays, slowing down the release of features and bug fixes.
- **Inconsistent Environments**: Discrepancies between development, testing, and production environments can cause unexpected issues during deployment.
- **Lack of Continuous Feedback**: Limited feedback loops make it difficult to identify and address issues promptly, affecting the overall quality of the software.

**DevOps** emerged as a solution to these challenges by promoting a culture of collaboration, integration, and automation between Development and Operations teams. By breaking down silos and fostering continuous collaboration, DevOps aims to streamline the SDLC, enhancing efficiency, reliability, and speed in software delivery.

## 2. Explanation of Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops) Parts
